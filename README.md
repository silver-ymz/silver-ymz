## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mingzhuo Yin

An undergraduate Computer Science student passionate about **Database Systems** and **Computer Architecture**.

I'm enthusiastic about building efficient and reliable low-level system software. I have had the privilege to contribute to the following work:

- **Academic Research**:
  - **Magellan**: a high-performance memory prefetcher. The research was published at **ISCA 2025**, a top-tier conference in computer architecture. [[Paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3695053.731054)

- **Open Source & Projects**:
  - **[pgvecto.rs](https://github.com/tensorchord/pgvecto.rs)**: a high-performance vector similarity search extension for PostgreSQL.
  - **[VectorChord-bm25](https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord-bm25)**: a BM25 ranking and indexing extension for PostgreSQL to enhance full-text search.
  - **[ByteHouse CDW](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/bytehouse/docs-bytehouse-overview)**: an enterprise-grade, cloud-native OLAP data warehouse in ByteDance.
  - **[Apache OpenDAL](https://github.com/apache/opendal)**: Contributor to the Apache top-level project, dedicated to building a unified open data access layer.

### ðŸ’¼ Open to Opportunities: Seeking Full-Time New Grad Roles

I am graduating in **2026** and am actively seeking **full-time software engineering positions** focusing on database internals, computer architecture, storage systems, or other related low-level systems.
